title: Toolbar
---

The toolbar is meant as a generic construct to position tools. It provides a structure where you can position items on the left, in the center and on the right.

The toolbar requires a parent .c-toolbar div that contains children that define the positioning: `.c-toolbar-left`, `.c-toolbar-right` and `.c-toolbar-center`.

The toolbar construct is used in many parts of the user interface: modals, panels, navbars and popovers all use the toolbar component to position elements in a consistent way.
